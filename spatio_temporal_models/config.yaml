# Gene Expression Simulation Configuration
# =========================================
# This file contains all parameters for the 3D stochastic gene expression simulation.

# Kinetic Rates
# -------------
# All rates are in units of 1/second

kinetics:
  k_on: 0.2              # Transcription site activation rate
  k_off: 0.1             # Transcription site deactivation rate
  k_r: 3.0               # RNA production rate (when TS is ON)
  gamma_r: 0.05          # RNA degradation rate
  k_p: 0.2               # Protein production rate (per cytoplasmic RNA)
  gamma_p: 0.65          # Protein degradation rate
  k_diff_r: 10.0         # RNA diffusion coefficient
  k_diff_p: 10.0         # Protein diffusion coefficient
  transport_rate: 2.0    # Nuclear export rate (for RNA near envelope)

# Cell Geometry (in pixels)
# -------------------------
# All sizes are [X, Y, Z] dimensions
# For half-ellipsoid shapes, these represent the full ellipsoid diameters
# (actual dome height is half the Z value)

geometry:
  simulation_volume_size: [512, 512, 100]   # Microscopy field of view
  cytosol_size: [350, 350, 80]              # Cell diameter/height
  nucleus_size: [120, 100, 60]              # Nucleus diameter/height
  nucleus_xy_offset: [0, 0]                 # Nucleus offset from center [X, Y]

# Simulation Settings
# -------------------

simulation:
  total_time: 100        # Total simulation time (seconds)
  frame_rate: 1          # Save state every N seconds
  burnin_time: 0         # Time before recording starts (seconds)

# Transcription Site Options
# --------------------------

transcription_site:
  position: random       # Options: 'center' or 'random'

# Protein Movement
# ----------------

movement:
  protein_into_nucleus: false   # Allow proteins to enter nucleus

# Drug Perturbation (optional)
# ----------------------------

drug:
  apply: false
  application_time: 120         # Time to apply drug (seconds)
  inhibited_parameters:
    transport_rate: 0.1         # New transport rate after drug

# Output Options
# ---------------

output:
  generate_gif: true            # Generate animated GIF of temporal evolution
  gif_fps: 4                    # Frames per second for GIF animation
  gif_skip_frames: 4            # Only render every Nth frame (1=all, 5=every 5th)
  gif_dpi: 80                   # DPI for GIF frames (lower = smaller file)
  gif_show_surfaces: false      # Show cell surfaces (SLOW - disable for faster generation)
